# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# =>User.first.accounts.last.activities.build(name: Time.now.to_s, kind: 'walking', distance: 100, duration: 1222, steps: 2343, points: 34323, calories: 39, start_date: Time.now.at_beginning_of_week, uid: '123223434').save
